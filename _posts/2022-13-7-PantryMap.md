I created PantryMap to help volunteers find nearby food pantries to volunteer at. PantryMap uses a combination of Google Map's API and, in NYC, a custom database with detailed volunteering instructions from the pantries themselves.
 
Contact me at [henrysgreenhut@gmail.com](mailto:henrysgreenhut@gmail.com) to submit volunteering information about a pantry.

Privacy Policy:
PantryMap does not collect any data. Location data is used but is not stored or associated with user.
